.NET Core console apps are cross-platform apps that use text input and output. 
Blazor WebAssembly lets you build web applications using C# code and HTML/CSS.
Razor lets you add C# code directly into your HTML markup. 

### HTML

# The class="row" attribute tells the page to render everything between <div> </div> in a single row.

# input="range" is an input tag with a type attribute that determines what kind of input controller appears on the screen.


### C#code

# @code {}		// use @ to embed C# code

# OnInitialized() method is called once after the page is loaded

# While loop does its TEST FIRST, then runs its statements only if true

# do/while runs the STATEMENT FIRST, then runs the test.

# for loops run a statement AFTER each loop
